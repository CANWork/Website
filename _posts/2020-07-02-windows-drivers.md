**Windows Only:** Windows users need to install an .inf file. 
You can [download](https://canable.io/utilities/windows-driver.zip) a zip of the driver.
To install: right-click on the .inf file, and click install. 

You may need to open your device manager, find the unknown cantact device, choose Update Driver and select the .inf file.

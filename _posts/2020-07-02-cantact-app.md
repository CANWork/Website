**Windows and OSX:** cantact-app is the easiest way to get up and running with your CANWork on Windows and Mac.
 
The [cantact-app](https://github.com/linklayer/cantact-app) is a Java program for viewing real-time CAN bus traffic and sending CAN packets. This tool connects directly to the virtual serial port of the CANable (or CANtact) device, and doesn't require any other drivers. 

Just [download](https://github.com/linklayer/cantact-app/releases/download/v0.3.0-alpha/cantact-v0.3.0-alpha.zip) the latest release, connect to your CANWork, and traffic should show up shortly.
Note: cantact-app runs on Linux but currently isn't able to discover serial ports.
